## Completed items

- Basic REPL (read-eval-print loop) for an expression evaluator
- Added lexer, a parser, and an evaluator
- Handle `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and parenthesized expressions
- Print syntax trees

## Interesting aspects

### Operator precedence

When parsing the expression `1 + 2 * 3` we need to parse it into a tree
structure that honors priorities, i.e. that `*` binds stronger than `+`:

```
BinaryExpression
├──NumberExpression
│   └──NumberToken 1
├──PlusToken
└──BinaryExpression
    ├──NumberExpression
    │   └──NumberToken 2
    ├──StarToken
    └──NumberExpression
        └──NumberToken 3
```

A naive parser might yield something like this:

```
BinaryExpression
├──BinaryExpression
│   ├──NumberExpression
│   │   └──NumberToken 1
│   ├──PlusToken
│   └──NumberExpression
│       └──NumberToken 2
├──StarToken
└──NumberExpression
    └──NumberToken 3
```

The problem with having incorrect trees is that you interpret results
incorrectly. For instance, when walking the first tree one would compute the
(correct) result `7` while the latter one would compute `9`.

In our parser (which is a handwritten [recursive descent parser][rdp]) we
achieved this by [structuring our method calls accordingly][parsing].

### Fabricating tokens

In some cases, the parser asserts that specific tokens are present. For example,
when parsing a parenthesized expression, it will assert that after consuming a
`(` and an `<expression>`, a `)` token follows. If the current token doesn't match
the expectation, it will fabricate a token out of thin air.

This is useful as it avoids cases where later parts of the compiler that walk
the syntax tree have to assume anything could be null.
